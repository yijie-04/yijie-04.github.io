I'm a student in the **Engineering Science** program at the **University of Toronto**, with a major in **Robotics** and a minor in **Global Leadership**. I just finished my 3rd year of undergraduate study and I'm currently on Co-op/PEY at General Motors as a **Simulation Intern** til April 2025. I'm also doing part-time **reinforcement learning research** at the Robot, Vision and Learning Lab, working on data augmentation for off-policy evaluation methods.

My research interests span computer vision, simulation and machine learning, particularly for the application of robot manipulators and autonomous vehicles. I enjoy designing and understanding systems that can interact with and navigate the real world. Alongside my technical pursuits, I'm also interested in how technology intersects with society and the world at large. I'm driven by the challenge of solving complex problems and creating robotics systems that push the boundaries of what machines can do. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to chat!
